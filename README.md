# Vicidial-10-Installation-Project-by-Junaid
"Hello, I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out to you regarding my recent project on Vicidial 10. 
I worked on this project as a way to challenge myself and expand my skills in the field of IT and cyber security. 
I chose Vicidial 10 specifically because it's a widely used open source call center software that's known for its efficiency and reliability. 
Throughout the project, I faced various challenges and setbacks, but ultimately learned a lot and was able to successfully complete the project. 
I'm happy to share my Github repository with you and would appreciate any feedback or insights you may have. Thank you for your time and consideration."
