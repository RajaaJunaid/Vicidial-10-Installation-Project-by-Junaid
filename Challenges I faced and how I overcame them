Since I was 14, I have been volunteering with the police and have had various responsibilities, such as office work, technical work, security, and other tasks. 
After my father's death, I became the sole breadwinner of my family and faced many challenges that nobody could have anticipated. Despite this, 
I persevered and remained strong for my family.

When I was 17, I left my job as a police officer and moved to Lahore, where I worked as an assistant account manager at a denim company. 
However, I always had an interest in learning about tech-related fields, and after two years, 
I moved back to my hometown of Karachi and landed a job at an IT office Telecom call center. I worked hard and was eager to learn about the tech field.

During my time at the call center, I gained experience in IT support as an IT customer support specialist. 
I provided support and solved problems in Vicidial, and during the installation process, I gained experience in cloud-based installation on Linux systems with commands. 
I faced many challenges, but I overcame them with my skills.

Working on the Vicidial 10 project aligned with my interest in learning about the IT tech field. Even though it was a completely new and challenging project for me, 
I believed in my passion and hard work, and I completed the installation and testing of the dialer in just 21 days. 
However, my colleague, whom I trusted and who was also my senior, stole my project and presented it to our boss as his own. 
Despite feeling unmotivated and frustrated, I remained positive and smiling and ultimately decided to leave the job.

Overall, my experiences have allowed me to gain valuable skills in IT support, installation, and problem-solving. I
am excited to continue learning and growing in this field and am grateful for the opportunities that have come my way.
